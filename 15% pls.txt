In terms of what I believe I have done to justify additional feature / functionality marks, there isn't all that much.

- I allow the user to input case insensitive commands as valid
- Frequent use of pointers for passing, editing, and reading process variables - less memory allocation over time
- Use of global variables (albeit possibly to ill effect)
- Attempt to clear the heap memory allocated during runtime on exit
- Program structure separated into source & header files - grouped by context & functionality
- use of malloc & realloc (as well as validating result & handling failure [i hope])


I was unable to implement STCF in time, unfortunately.
